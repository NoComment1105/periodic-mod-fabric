Elements from the periodic table in Minecraft 1.16.x

### What is the purpose of this datapack?
You can get a lot of tool drops from Minecraft mobs. and usually they come on iron or gold tools/weapons/armour; and that can be a pain becuase it  renders then useless usually. But this pack here allows you to put any tool/weapon/armour piece in the smithing table and upgrade it to the next level


### Features
Adds Uranium Lumps, Uranium Ore and Uranium Block

**MORE COMING SOON**
